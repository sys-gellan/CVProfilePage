abstract: Finite temperature micromagnetic simulations were used to investigate the
  magnetisation structure, propagation dynamics and stochastic pinning of domain walls
  in rare earth-doped Ni80Fe20 nanowires. We first show how the increase of the Gilbert
  damping, caused by the inclusion rare-earth dopants such as holmium, acts to suppress
  Walker breakdown phenomena. This allows domain walls to maintain consistent magnetisation
  structures during propagation. We then employ finite temperature simulations to
  probe how this affects the stochastic pinning of domain walls at notch-shaped artificial
  defect sites. Our results indicate that the addition of even a few percent of holmium
  allows domain walls to pin with consistent and well-defined magnetisation configurations,
  thus suppressing dynamically-induced stochastic pinning/depinning phenomena. Together,
  these results demonstrate a powerful, materials science-based solution to the problems
  of stochastic domain wall pinning in soft ferromagnetic nanowires.
