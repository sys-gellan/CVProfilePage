abstract: "Abstract Nonvolatile logic networks based on spintronic and nanomagnetic\
  \ technologies have the potential to create high-speed, ultralow power computational\
  \ architectures. This article explores the feasibility of “chirality-encoded domain\
  \ wall logic,” a nanomagnetic logic architecture where data are encoded by the chiral\
  \ structures of mobile domain walls in networks of ferromagnetic nanowires and processed\
  \ by the chiral structures' interactions with geometric features of the networks.\
  \ High-resolution magnetic imaging is used to test two critical functionalities:\
  \ the inversion of domain wall chirality at tailored artificial defect sites (logical\
  \ NOT gates) and the chirality-selective output of domain walls from 2-in-1-out\
  \ nanowire junctions (common operation to AND/NAND/OR/NOR gates). The measurements\
  \ demonstrate both operations can be performed to a good degree of fidelity even\
  \ in the presence of complex magnetization dynamics that would normally be expected\
  \ to destroy chirality-encoded information. Together, these results represent a\
  \ strong indication of the feasibility of devices where chiral magnetization textures\
  \ are used to directly carry, rather than merely delineate, data."
