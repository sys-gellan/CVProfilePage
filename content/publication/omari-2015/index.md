abstract: The interactions of vortex domain walls with corners in planar magnetic
  nanowires are probed using magnetic soft X-ray transmission microscopy. We show
  that when the domain walls are propagated into sharp corners using applied magnetic
  fields above a critical value, their chiralities are rectified to either clockwise
  or anticlockwise circulation depending on whether the corners turn left or right.
  Single-shot focused magneto-optic Kerr effect measurements are then used to demonstrate
  how, when combined with modes of domain propagation that conserve vortex chirality,
  this allows us to dramatically reduce the stochasticity of domain pinning at artificial
  defect sites. Our results provide a tool for controlling domain wall chirality and
  pinning behavior both in further experimental studies and in future domain wall-based
  memory, logic and sensor technologies.
